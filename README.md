Implementing the required stories worked out fine. However, I encountered many problems when trying to implement the search bar, the network alert controller, and sometimes accessing the details page through the superhero view controller.

1. Implement more practical constraint placements

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to differentiate the different type of constraints and when/where to use them.
2. What are the ideal constraints to use in certain places?

## Notes

There were many challenges encountered while implementing constraints to the Now Playing VC and the Detail VC. Luckily, the Now Playing VC is functional accross all devices. However, with the detail VC, when viewing in landscape the background poster does not adjust to its 1:3 ratio. This causes an overlap with the text and the inability to clearly see it.
